### 👋 Hi there... Welcome!!!

&nbsp;        
I'm thrilled you're interested in my profile.      
Feel free to browse through my account to your heart's content.      
To make this process easy for you, I've gone ahead to group my projects into "organizations". They are:          
&nbsp;  

- [Ofega at Lambda School](https://github.com/Ofega-at-Lambda-School): This organization contains all the exercises, projects and challenges I worked on whilst at Lambda School. Lambda School is a 9-month long remote coding boot-camp.

- [Ofega Tech Exploration](https://github.com/UT-MSC-SWE): Sometimes, I take online courses on different aspects of technology. This organization contains a summary of things learnt as well as exploratory practice. It is also a place I can put my experimental projects.

- [1000 Frontend Engineering Challenges](https://github.com/1000-Frontend-Engineering-Challenges): I enjoy building software. I think the thrill for me is figuring out how to implement a specific feature or task, you know, the gotchas. On this note, I work on frontend engineering challenges put out by companies as part of their hiring process. I also try to journal about my experience cause it's cool to look back.
